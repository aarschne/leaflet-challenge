# leaflet-challenge

I used the class examples of earthquake plots to do the basic skeleton of the code. I had some help with the legend portion of the code - Greg Michalek from our bootcamp helped me with the code. He provided a snippet from the leaflet documentation, and then I modified it to fit with what I was doing with my code (specifically my graduations and the colors I chose). My altered version of his snippet appears on lines 80 to 101 in logic.js.
